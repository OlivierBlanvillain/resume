EXPERIENCE
==========

\y{2014}EPFL, part-time student project. Development of SlickChair\ [1]: a conference management system made with the Play framework and Slick. This full-stack development experience allowed me to acquire competencies in many aspects of product development; from the establishment of specifications, the choice of technologies, the implementation, to the deployment of the system in production.

\y{2013}CERN, six-month internship. Design and implementation of the BlogForever crawler\ [2]. I completed the project very fast, in about 3 months, and used remaining time to document with a full-length scientific publication\ [3]. My novel content extraction algorithm was evaluated with a 93% success rate, outperforming the state-of-the-art solutions by more than 5%.


PROJECTS
========

\y{2015}EPFL Master Project: Scala.js networking made easy (ongoing).
In this project I'm designing a networking library that offers a simple, unified and type-safe solution to browser-server communication.

\y{2014}Main technical reviewer of *Slick Queries in Scala*, ISBN 8113OS

\y{2014}Library for functional programming in Unix Shell\ [4]
