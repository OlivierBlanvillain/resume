# Experience

\y{2013}CERN (IT-CIS-DLS), six-month internship: design and implementation of the *BlogForever Crawler*\ [2]. The project was completed very fast, in about half of the allocated time, and the remaining time was used to document my work with a scientific publication\ [3]. My novel content extraction algorithm was evaluated with a 93% success rate, 5% better than the state-of-the-art solution.


# Projects

\y{2015}EPFL (LAMP), master project: (ongoing) *Scala.js networking made easy*. In this project I am designing a networking library that offers a simple, unified and type-safe solution to browser-server communication.

\y{2014}EPFL (LARA), semester project: *SlickChair conference management system*\ [1], developed from scractch using Play Framework and Slick. Experienced many aspects of software development; from the establishment of specifications, the choice of technologies, the implementation, to the deployment in production. The first SlickChair instance was used for the FMCAD 2014 student forum and is planned to be used for future Scala conferences.

\y{2014}Library for functional programming in Unix Shell\ [4]

\y{2012}Minimal content management system using Google Docs\ [5]

\y{2011}EPFL, semester project: Parallelization of a collaborative filtering algorithm with Menthor\ [6]

\y{2010}Java bot for a flash puzzle game\ [7]
